Please read [the relevant official guides](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/guide) to ease your journey.

# Contributors

For contributors interested in PCL:

* Please announce yourself and your interest in PCL at [the discord channel](https://discord.gg/JFFMAXS)
* Please have a draft proposal ready in the format of a **git-repo/google doc** to facilitate discussion
    * During the selection and submission phase, mentors often communicate with the candidates on the proposal merits/feasibility
    * Having a format where adding comments in-line with content is easy makes this communication quick and easy
    * Proposals not in a google doc or git will not be entertained
* Based on your interests, you will be assigned a small task to evaluate your skills

# Mentors

For those interested in becoming mentors:

* Please note that mentoring and co-mentoring can take a lot of effort from your side (from 10 hours a week or 1 hour a week depending on the project, the student, the problems, etc.)
* Please announce yourself and participate in discussions at [the discord channel](https://discord.gg/JFFMAXS)
* Feel free to PM existing maintainers/mentors
* "Teaming up" as co-mentors is an option if you feel you will not be able to be the sole mentor on a project. For projects with existing mentor(s), it is upto them to accept/reject a co-mentor
